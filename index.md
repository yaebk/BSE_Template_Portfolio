# Midi Controller
 A midi controller is a creative tool that sends and recieves MIDI messages from your device. The knobs, buttons, and sliders can be programmed to do virtually anything desired, making the midi controller unique to the user. Thus, allowing users to expand their imagination and be creative when combining sounds on the controller.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up the circuit for my potentiometer. I connected 5 wires from the breadboard to the arduino, and set up the led using a resistor and of course inserting the potentiometer. Verifying and uploading the code in my Arduino IDE, I was able to get my led to light up. As I turn the knob to the right, the led will glow brighter and as I turn the knob to the left the led glows darker until no more light is emitted. The hardest part when attempting to set up the potentiometer was getting the wires to its corresponding pin. I had to differentiate between the analog and digital side on my arduino, and be able to identify the ground, input, and power pins on the potentiometer.
