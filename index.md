# Midi Controller
During these three weeks, I have been working on a midi controller similar to a musical instrument capable of producing any kind of sound desired.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the potentiometer, getting the LED to blink in shorter or longer intervals based on where the knob on the potentiometer was turned.
